# SVM

Support Vector Machines are supervised models in classification and regression analysis. SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.

Developed to classify spam data.
